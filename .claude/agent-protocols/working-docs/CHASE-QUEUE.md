# Chase Queue

**Public document — safe-for-public content only.**
This file is tracked in the public repo. Do NOT add internal dev commentary,
private decisions, sensitive architecture notes, or anything not suitable for
public viewing. Entries must be code-pattern observations only.

---

Cross-file work identified during inline sessions that was NOT chased at the time.
Agents append here when they spot an issue outside their current file scope.
Entries are batched into dedicated sprint sessions when a cluster forms.

**Review cadence:** At the start of each sprint, scan for clusters (5+ entries of
the same type or package) that warrant a focused session. Delete cleared entries
and add a dated log entry at the bottom.

## Sprint clusters

When 5+ entries share a Type or package, open a dedicated sprint:

| Cluster | Threshold | Sprint agent |
|---------|-----------|-------------|
| `LOG` / `WARN` in a package | 5+ | WRAITH (~30-60 min) |
| `RETURN` | 5+ | MITHRIL (~1h) |
| `SENDER` / `CLASSIC` in a subsystem | 5+ | LOOM (~2-4h) |
| `IMPLICIT` | 10+ | MITHRIL Part 3a (full day) |
| `EXCEPT` | 3+ | PRISM review first |
